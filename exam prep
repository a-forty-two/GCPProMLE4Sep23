Pub/Sub -> pub sub can’t deal with late arrival of data, out of order data, and data packets have been damaged
Correct approach->

PUB/SUB ——> DataFlow ——> anywhere else

Normalize:
Sigmoid-> 0-1. MinMax -> 0-1, Z-Score-> -3 to +3, tanh-> -1 to +1


Binning-> group the data into a single feature
          -> lat / long 

Time/temporal values-> normalization?
            Cyclic-> sin theta/cos theta
